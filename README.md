# WHODIDIT: OpenStreetMap Changeset Analyzer

This tool downloads replication diffs from OSM Planet site, calculates statistics on changes
and registers which 0.01-degree tiles were affected, and stores this in a MySQL database.
A series of PHP scripts and a JS frontend are used to access that data.

You can check a working installation at https://simon04.dev.openstreetmap.org/whodidit/

## Installation

There is a docker-compose.yml which should be self-contained. It isn't really hardened for security,
so might not be a good idea to use for more than local testing.

    wdi_password=password docker compose up --build

should be enough.

If you're using this local setup to work around the upstream website being down, it is suggested to
edit `scripts/parse_osc.pl` around line 38 first, changing `my $hours_to_import_if_no_previous_state = 0;`
to the number of hours the upstream site has been down, e.g. `my $hours_to_import_if_no_previous_state = 24 * 20;`
for 20 days.

For manual setup, see the following sections.

### Perl and system dependencies

You will need `libxml2` and the development headers:

    apt-get install libxml2-dev 

Install Perl dependencies

    cpan DBIx::Simple LWP::Simple XML::LibXML::Reader Devel::Size

### Database

Make a directory outside www root (for example, `/home/?/whodidit`)
and place `parse_osc.pl` there. Then create mysql database with utf8 collation and grant a user
right to create and update tables there. After that, create database tables:

    ./parse_osc.pl -h <host> -d <database> -u <user> -p <password> -c -v

Add the script to crontab:

    6 * * * * /home/?/whodidit/parse_osc.pl -h <host> -d <database> -u <user> -p <password> \
        -l https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/hour/ \
        -s /home/?/whodidit/state.txt -w /usr/local/bin/wget

Now each hour your database will be updated with fresh data. Note that the same osmChange
file **should not** be processed twice: the database has no means of skipping already
processed files.

### Frontend

Make a directory inside www root, for example, `/var/www/whodidit`. Put all files
from `www` directory in it. Then create another directory, `/var/www/whodidit/scripts`
and put there all four PHP scripts from `scripts`.

Update the line `<script>var scripts = 'http://localhost/wdi/scripts/';</script>` in `index.html`
with the absolute URL of the directory you've put PHP files in. Then edit
`db.inc.php` script, updating `$frontend_url` variable with the absolute path to `index.html`.

Then write your database parameters into a new file `scripts/config.inc.php` in the format given in `scripts/config.inc.php.template`.

## What do scripts do?

* `parse_osc.pl`: This script downloads and parses replication diffs, storing changeset information
    in a MySQL database. It can create tables (with `-c` switch). Run it without parameters
    to see a list of all possible options.
* `db.inc.php`: Global settings for PHP scripts, also two useful functions (which can be updated
    in later versions, so be careful not to lose your settings -- sorry).
* `tiles.php`: Queries the database for tiles in an area. Returns JSON with either error message
    (large areas and areas that have more than 1000 tiles are rejected) or all tiles with changeset
    numbers and other information.
* `changeset.php`: Returns a JSON with detailed information for requested changeset ids. When
    called with `latest=1` parameter, returns the latest changeset.
* `rss.php`: As the title suggests, it generated an RSS feed with the latest changesets in a bbox.
* `index.html`: The HTML page is a front-end to WDI infrastructure. It makes use of all PHP scripts
    and allows user to check WDI tiles and aquire RSS links.
* `whodidit.js`: The JavaScript behind the front-end.
